## Requirements

- Python **>= 3.10**
> [!NOTE]
> You can play Motus wih a version Python < 3.10, but you need to get a version **< 4.0** of my program.

- Install a module who is called `rich`. To install this module:
  - Open Terminal
  - Verify if `pip` is works :
    - Write in the Terminal this command: `pip`
    - Doesn't work ? Reinstall Python to the last version or search this issue
  - If the command `pip` works, write this command to install `rich` :
  > pip install rich
  - Good job!
- Download with the program the file `Dictionnaire.txt`. If this file is not downloaded, you will have an error!
